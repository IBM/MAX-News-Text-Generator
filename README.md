# IBM Code Model Asset Exchange: News Text Generator

This repository contains code to instantiate and deploy a text generation model. This model recognizes a text file as an
input and outputs a string. The model was trained on the One Billion Word Benchmark (http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.3005)
data set. The input to the model is a simple text file, and the output is a string containing the words that are
predicted to follow. The model has a vocabulary of approximately 800,000 words.

The model files are hosted on [IBM Cloud Object Storage](http://max-assets.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/news-text-generator/1.0/assets.tar.gz). The code in this repository deploys the model as a web service
in a Docker container. This repository was developed as part of the
[IBM Code Model Asset Exchange](https://developer.ibm.com/code/exchanges/models/) and the public API is powered by
[IBM Cloud](https://ibm.biz/Bdz2XM).

## Pre-requisites:

**Note:** this model can be very memory intensive. If you experience crashes (such as the model API process terminating with a `Killed` message), ensure your docker container has sufficient resources allocated (for example you may need to increase the default memory limit on [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/#advanced-tab) or [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/#advanced)). 

* `docker`: The [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) command-line interface. Follow the [installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/install/) for your system.
* The minimum recommended resources for this model is 8 GB Memory and 4 CPUs.

# Steps

1. [Deploy from Docker Hub](#deploy-from-docker-hub)
2. [Deploy on Kubernetes](#deploy-on-kubernetes)
3. [Run Locally](#run-locally)

## Deploy from Docker Hub

To run the docker image, which automatically starts the model serving API, run:

```
$ docker run -it -p 5000:5000 codait/max-news-text-generator
```

This will pull a pre-built image from Docker Hub (or use an existing image if already cached locally) and run it.
If you'd rather checkout and build the model locally you can follow the [run locally](#run-locally) steps below.

## Deploy on Kubernetes

You can also deploy the model on Kubernetes using the latest docker image on Docker Hub.

On your Kubernetes cluster, run the following commands:

```
$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/MAX-News-Text-Generator/master/max-news-text-generator.yaml
```

The model will be available internally at port `5000`, but can also be accessed externally through the `NodePort`.

A more elaborate tutorial on how to deploy this MAX model to production on [IBM Cloud](https://ibm.biz/Bdz2XM) can be
found [here](http://ibm.biz/max-to-ibm-cloud-tutorial).

## Run Locally

1. [Build the Model](#1-build-the-model)
2. [Deploy the Model](#2-deploy-the-model)
3. [Use the Model](#3-use-the-model)
4. [Development](#4-development)
5. [Cleanup](#5-cleanup)

### 1. Build the Model

Clone this repository locally. In a terminal, run the following command:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/IBM/MAX-News-Text-Generator.git
```

Change directory into the repository base folder:

```
$ cd MAX-News-Text-Generator
```

To build the docker image locally, run: 

```
$ docker build -t max-news-text-generator .
```

All required model assets will be downloaded during the build process. _Note_ that currently this docker image is CPU only (we will add support for GPU images later).


### 2. Deploy the Model

To run the docker image, which automatically starts the model serving API, run:

```
$ docker run -it -p 5000:5000 max-news-text-generator
```

### 3. Use the Model

The API server automatically generates an interactive Swagger documentation page. Go to `http://localhost:5000` to load
it. From there you can explore the API and also create test requests.

Use the `model/predict` endpoint to load some seed text (you can use one of the test files from the `samples` folder)
and get predicted output from the API.

You can also test it on the command line, for example:

```
$ curl -F "text=@samples/sample1.txt" -XPOST http://localhost:5000/model/predict
```

You should see a JSON response like that below:

```json
{"status": "ok", "pred_txt": "This is a test rather than an alternative view . </S> "}
```

### 4. Development

To run the Flask API app in debug mode, edit `config.py` to set `DEBUG = True` under the application settings. You will then need to rebuild the docker image (see [step 1](#1-build-the-model)).

### 5. Cleanup

To stop the docker container type `CTRL` + `C` in your terminal.

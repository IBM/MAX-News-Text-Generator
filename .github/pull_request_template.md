Note: Travis CI is unable to fully test this model due to memory limitations. Please verify the Docker Actions tests
passed and/or run tests locally.

To run the test locally follow [the instructions](../README.md#1-build-the-model) in the README to build and run the model,
then run `pytest tests/tests.py`. See [.travis.yml](../.travis.yml) for an example.
